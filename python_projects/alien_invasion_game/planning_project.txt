Planning is realling important for large projects.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom
center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrorw
keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens
fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys 
the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves 
faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the 
bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, 
the game ends.

1. Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the sceen, with appropriate sapcing
around it.

2. Fill the upper portion of the screen with as many aliens as we can fit horizontally
. We'll then create additional rows of aliens until we have a full fleet.

3. Make the fleet move sideways and down until the enitre fleet is shot down,
an alien hit the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the entire fleet is shot
down, we'll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the ship or the ground, we'll 
destroy the ship and create a new fleet.

4. Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when the player has 
used up the allotted number of ships.
