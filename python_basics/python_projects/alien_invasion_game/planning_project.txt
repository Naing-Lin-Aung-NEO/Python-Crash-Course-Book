Planning is realling important for large projects.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom
center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrorw
keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens
fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys 
the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves 
faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the 
bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, 
the game ends.
